# Addressables

Addressable Asset System can simplify your content management at both edit and runtime so your games initial and updated releases are smoother and easier.

The Addressable Asset System (i.e., Addressables) is a Unity Editor and runtime asset management system that improves support for large production teams with complex live content delivery needs. The system uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies.
